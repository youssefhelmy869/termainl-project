Terminal Project

A custom-built C++ terminal simulation using SFML for input and output windows.
This project demonstrates low-level handling of input/output, screen rendering, and process management.

✨ Features

Terminal Management: Centralized control with the termainl class.

Input Process: screen_process.cpp handles event loops and keyboard interactions.

Output Screens:

output_screen.hpp → configurable output screen with custom names.

basic_screen.hpp → a minimal output screen with "main window".

Clean Architecture: Clear separation between input, output, and main control.

Extensible: Easy to add more screens, processes, or features later.
